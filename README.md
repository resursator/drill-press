I hadn't plan it as "mass market" model, but mostly as inspiration for other. So there are no exact parts and instruction.

Anyway. Here is stl https://github.com/DCSets/drill-press/blob/main/Drill%20v13.stl (split it by objects) and 3d model https://a360.co/3HAPs8Z

If you are interested - you can use this video as semi-guide (you'll find some details about build and highlighted issues)
